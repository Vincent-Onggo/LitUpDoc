             RustDesk Server Setup using Docker
===================================================

This guide will walk you through setting up a RustDesk server using Docker,
updating it to use your public IP, configuring the necessary paths, and 
setting up port forwarding and firewall rules.

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Docker installed on your machine
- Access to your router for port forwarding and hairpin NAT configuration
- Administrator access to Windows Defender Firewall settings

Steps:
------

1. Clone the RustDesk Server Template from GitHub
-------------------------------------------------
First, clone the repository from GitHub:

   git clone https://github.com/liho00/rustdesk-server-docker-template.git
   cd rustdesk-server-docker-template

2. Update Docker Compose Configuration
--------------------------------------
Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and make the following changes:

- Change to Public IP: Update the `PUBLIC_IP` environment variable to your public IP address.
- Use Absolute Paths for hbbs and hbbr: Update the paths to hbbs and hbbr to absolute paths.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  hbbs:
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    container_name: hbbs
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_IP=<your-public-ip>
    volumes:
      - /absolute/path/to/hbbs:/root
    ports:
      - "21114:21114"
      - "21116:21116"
    restart: unless-stopped

  hbbr:
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    container_name: hbbr
    volumes:
      - /absolute/path/to/hbbr:/root
    ports:
      - "21115:21115"
      - "21117:21117"
    restart: unless-stopped
Run Docker Containers
Start the RustDesk server containers:

docker-compose up -d

To stop the containers, use:

docker-compose down

To check the status of the containers, use:

docker ps

Configure Port Forwarding and Hairpin NAT on Your Router
Log in to your router and configure port forwarding for the following ports:

ID Server (hbbs): Forward external port 21116 to internal port 21116 on the server's local IP address.
Relay Server (hbbr): Forward external port 21117 to internal port 21117 on the server's local IP address.
Enable hairpin NAT (also known as NAT loopback) to allow devices within your local network to access the server using the public IP address.

Allow Ports Through Windows Defender Firewall
Open Windows Defender Firewall settings and allow inbound and outbound traffic for the following ports:

21114
21115
21116
21117
To do this:

Open Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall.
Click on "Advanced settings".
Add new inbound and outbound rules for each port mentioned above.
Retrieve and Use the Public Key
Print out the public key using the following command:

cat id_2259.id

Copy the public key.

Update the RustDesk parameters with the public key. This can typically be done in the RustDesk client settings where you specify the ID and relay server details:

ID Server: <your-public-ip>:21116
Relay Server: <your-public-ip>:21117
Public Key: Paste the copied public key into the key parameter.

End of RustDesk Server Setup Guide


Maintenance:
Start Server: docker-compose up -d
Stop Server: docker-compose down
Check Server Status: docker ps

IF ADMIN ACCESS ISSUES: Use sudo docker-compose up -d
